### Abstract

In this chapter, we explore Bayesian approaches to modelling compositional data that evolve
over time. This requires methods that account for both the compositional structure and
temporal dependence. When the time series consists of count data, a log-ratio transformation
approach is unsuitable, motivating an approach that can handle the non-smooth time series
of compositional counts.

Here, we propose a novel Bayesian hierarchical modelling framework that combines a Generalised-
Dirichlet-Multinomial (GDM) distribution for compositional counts with a latent hidden
Markov model (HMM) structure to capture non-smooth temporal dependence. We apply
the methodology to a COVID-19 variant data including non-smooth count over time con-
taining zeros. We assess our approach and compare the effectiveness to other common time
series models through a posterior predictive experiment.
