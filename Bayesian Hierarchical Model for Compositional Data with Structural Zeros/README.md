### Abstract 


We investigate Bayesian hierarchical approaches to modelling compositional data with a
large proportion of structural zeros in the compositions and a multilevel hierarchical struc-
ture. The typical approach of applying a log-ratio transformation is unsuitable here, as
log-ratios are undefined for zeros. Additionally, we will need to ensure that we suitably
account for correlation arising from the hierarchical structure.

Here, we propose a flexible integrated clustering approach within a Bayesian hierarchical
model framework for compositional data with structural zeros; we apply the methodology
to a forensic elemental glass database that poses this challenge, where zeros are considered
to be true zeros or values below some detection limit that have been rounded down to zero.
We assess our approach and compare it to others in terms of use-type classification of glass
items, using a five-fold cross-validation approach
