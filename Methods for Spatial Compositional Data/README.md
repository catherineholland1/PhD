### Abstract

In this chapter, we propose an approach to modelling compositional data arranged over
a spatial domain, such that we need to account for both the compositional and spatial
structures. Furthermore, we target the additional challenges of accounting for both zero and
missing values in the spatial compositions.

Here, we propose a framework combining the Generalised-Dirichlet-Multinomial (GDM)
family of distributions with two-dimensional penalised regression splines that capture spatial
structure. We evaluate our approach through two posterior predictive experiments, one to
assess a novel variance parameter specification and another to assess how well the framework
can predict missing compositional counts.
